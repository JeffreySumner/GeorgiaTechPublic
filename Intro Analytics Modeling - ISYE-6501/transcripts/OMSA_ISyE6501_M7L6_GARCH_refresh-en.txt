>> In previous lessons we saw methods like
exponential smoothing and its generalization
ARIMA for estimating or forecasting
the value is something for
which we have time series data.
In this lesson, we will see
the generalized autoregressive
conditional heteroscedasticity
or GARCH method.
If you want a real challenge,
try saying generalized
autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity
five times in a row as fast as possible.
We can organize the competition
at the end of the semester.
GARCH is a way to estimate or forecast
the variance of something
for which we have time series data.
But first, before seeing GARCH itself,
let's take a minute to see why we would want to
consider estimating or forecasting variance.
In general, knowing the variance of something can help
us estimate the amount of
error there might be in our estimate.
For example, if we're forecasting the demand for
pickup trucks to determine how many to manufacture,
the variance can help tell us how much
our forecast might be higher
or lower than the true value,
so we can plan accordingly.
Variance estimation is
especially important in investment.
The traditional portfolio optimization model balances
the expected return of a set of
investments with its amount of volatility.
Some people prefer riskier portfolio
with a higher expected return,
and others prefer less risky portfolio and are willing to
accept lower expected return in exchange for less risk.
In these models, the variance is
often used as a proxy for the amount of
volatility or risk and GARCH
is a common approach for estimating variance.
We're not going to get into
much mathematical detail of the GARCH model,
but here's what it looks like.
You'll notice that it looks a lot like
the ARIMA model that we saw in our previous lesson.
There are only two differences.
First, we're dealing with variances and squared
errors rather than observations and linear error terms.
And second, we deal only with the variances.
We don't use differences of variances the
way we use differences of observations in ARIMA.
Other than that, the models have very similar structure,
and just like good statistical software,
can fit an ARIMA PDQ model for you,
it can also fit a GARCH PQ model.
The GARCH model doesn't need a d
parameter again because it doesn't use differences.
So we've now seen three methods for analyzing
time-series data: exponential smoothing;
ARIMA, which is
a generalization of exponential smoothing;
and GARCH, which is
an ARIMA-like model for analyzing variance.
There are other approaches of course,
but these are the most common and the most
generally useful when dealing with time series data.
