>> In a previous lesson,
we've talked about the support vector machine
or SVM model for classification.
One of the most common questions about
the support vector machine model is what it's name means.
In this lesson, that's what we'll talk about.
Here's is the set of points.
If we connect the dots around
the outside of the points like this,
it's called the convex hull of the points,
but you don't need to know that.
Then we get this shape.
The shape looks like it's just floating here.
And if there is gravity,
it might just fall down,
but we can use this line to hold it up.
If the shape is correctly balanced on the line,
then this point where they touch is supporting the shape.
It's called the support vector.
I suppose it could be called the support
point but each point is a vector of data,
so they're called support vectors.
Support vectors don't even need
the line to be below the shape.
For the pure mathematical definition,
a support vector could be supporting
from the side or even from the top.
Depending on the line we choose,
we can even have more than one support vector.
In the basic support vector machine model
for classification,
remember that we're looking for
these two parallel lines
that are as far apart as possible,
while still having all the points of
each color on one side of the lines.
As you can see,
those two points are support vectors.
And because the model takes
the dataset and automatically determines
where those two lines should
be and what the support vectors are,
it's called the support vector machine model,
and that's where the name comes from.
Wait, before you go,
here's one more observation about
the support vector machine model.
Remember that the classifier we're looking for is
actually between the two parallel lines.
And therefore it's in-between
the support vectors not touching either of them.
So the odd thing about naming this,
the support vector machine approach
is that the classifier it
returns is actually not one of
the lines touching a support vector.
But that doesn't really make a difference.
The next time you use
the term suppor vector machine around your non-analytic,
savvy friends, it'll still sound pretty
impressive and even more so
now that you can show them what it means.
