Director of the Master of Science in
Analytics degree at Georgia Tech and a professor
in Georgia Tech's Stewart School of SYE.
In a previous topic,
we saw classification models where we had a set
of data points that we want to separate into groups.
Now, we've learned about clustering models,
where we have a set of data points
that we want to separate into groups.
What's the difference between these two models?
The difference is what we know about the data points.
In the classification model,
we know each data points attributes,
and we already know
the right classification for the data points.
We already know the response.
If we're looking at loan application data,
we already know whether each data point is classified
as blue meaning that they repaid their loan in full,
or red meaning that they did
not repay their loan in full.
That information helps us to decide how
to classify new points or new applicants.
The model uses both the attributes
and the responsive each data point.
On the other hand, in the clustering model,
we don't know upfront the
right grouping of our data points.
We know their attributes,
but we don't know what group any of these points are in.
The model has to decide how to
cluster based only on the attributes of the data.
That's a key difference,
key enough that as usual,
there's some analytics jargon to describe it.
When we've observed the right
answer for each data point,
and we're using that information in addition to
attributes to figure out how
to deal with new data points,
like in classification that's called supervised learning.
And when we haven't observed
the response for each data point,
and we're only using attribute information
to figure out how to deal with those data points,
like in clustering,
that's called unsupervised learning.
Situations that require supervised
learning are probably more common in analytics,
and we'll spend a fair amount of this course
talking about different supervised learning models.
But unsupervised learning, especially clustering,
is very useful to and can be
an important tool in the analytics toolbox.
