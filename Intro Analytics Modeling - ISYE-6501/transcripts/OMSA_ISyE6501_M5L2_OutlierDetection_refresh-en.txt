>> Hi, I'm Joel Sokol,
Director of the Master of Science in Analytics degree at
Georgia Tech and a professor in
Georgia Tech's Stewart School of ISYE.
In this lesson, we're going to talk about outliers,
data points that are very different from the rest
of the dataset we'll see what they are,
how to find them, and what to do about them.
As a preview, I can tell you that the answer is as usual,
almost always it depends,
but it's even more true for outliers because there are
philosophical issues as well as statistical one's.
An outlier is a data point that's
very different from the rest of the dataset,
the most obvious form of outliers where the value of
a data point is very different from
the rest of the data like in this picture,
0.01 is very different from the rest,
this is sometimes called a point outlier,
and it's what comes to most people's minds
when they hear the term outlier.
But also in this dataset,
we might call the few points at O2 outliers also,
because there are only a few of them and they are very
different from the overwhelming majority of the data,
you might wonder whether
the O2 points are really outliers.
Maybe there's a good reason for them
being there and you might be right.
We'll discuss that issue soon,
but before that, let's see
another couple of types of outliers.
Here's a picture of an outlier in time-series data.
It has just one point
that's far from the rest of the curve,
the temperature value at
this point isn't itself an outlier,
but the time at which it occurs makes it
an outlier compared to the rest of the data.
This type of outlier is sometimes called the contextual
outlier because it relies on
the context provided by the other points.
And here's a case of
time series data where there's an outlier by omission,.
In this heartbeat data,
it looks like there should be a large beat
around times 6,000, but there isn't.
It's hard to tell exactly
which data points should be called wrong,
but sometime in there between time
5,000 milliseconds and time 7,000 milliseconds,
it seems like there's something missing.
This type of outlier is sometimes called the collective
outlier because the data points
collectively seem to be an outlier,
we could also think of this in terms
of the time between beats.
If we track that data,
then most inter beat times will
be around 1,000 milliseconds,
except the one between 5,000 and 7,000,
which will be a point outlier
of about 2,000 milliseconds.
That was the easy part,
looking at pictures and noticing outliers,
the hardest part is deciding what to do once
we've found an outlier but before that,
let's talk about how to find
outliers in a more automated way.
To find point outliers in just one dimension,
we could use a box and whisker plot.
The top and bottom of the box,
or the 25th and 75th percentiles of the values and
the horizontal line through the middle of the box
is the median, the 50th percentile.
The vertical lines up and down
from the box are called the whiskers
and they stretch up and down to what you might
think is a reasonable range of values,
for example, we might pick the 10th,
90th percentiles are the fifth and 95th.
Beyond that, we plot a point for
each value that's outside the reasonable range,
and those points are possible outliers.
Unfortunately, there's not
a good all-purpose way of detecting
multi-dimensional outliers or other types
of outliers that we could use upfront.
But one thing we could do is to build a model,
fit the parameters, and then see
which points have a lot of error, for example,
suppose we fit an exponential
smoothing model to this data,
it's a nice smooth function and in each time period,
the errors between the actual value on
the model's estimate will be small, except here.
At this point, the model's error will be very large,
the model will expect a point that's right up on
the smooth curve and the actual value is far from it,
but that's only half the battle.
Once you've found an outlier,
the next question is,
what should you do about it?
That's a question we'll deal with in an upcoming lesson.
