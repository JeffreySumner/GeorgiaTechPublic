>> In a previous lesson,
we saw some examples of
when detecting changes could be valuable.
Measuring manufacturing performance,
evaluating the effect of promotions on sales,
determining whether national policy changes
had the desired effect, etc.
We also saw a specific example
detecting rail car axles that are going to fail soon,
where we needed a flexible approach
that can give us an answer quickly.
Quickly enough that it can detect
the temperature change before the axle breaks.
In this lesson, we will see
the CUSUM approach to change detection.
The name CUSUM is short for
a cumulative sum and it answers the question,
has the mean of the observed distribution
gone beyond a critical level?
CUSUM can detect when
a process gets to a higher level than before,
or to a lower level than before, or both.
In this lesson, we'll look first at detecting
increases and then show how to use
the same method to detect decreases.
Suppose we have some data X_t,
where X_t is the observed value at time t. For example,
X_t might be the price of a stock on day t,
the measured temperature of
a rail car axle at time t, etc.
Let's call a Mu, the expected value of
the observations x if there is no change.
So for each observation,
X_t minus Mu is how much above expected
the observation is at time
t. Now let's see the CUSUM metric.
I'll put it up here first and then talk
through what each piece means and how it works.
The basic idea is to calculate
a metric S_t and declare that we've observed
a change when and if that metric goes above
a threshold T. At each time period,
we observe X_t and see
how far above the expectation it is.
Then we add that amount to the previous period's metric,
S_t minus 1 to give a running total S_t.
If that running total so far
is greater than zero, we keep it.
But if it's less than zero,
we just reset the running total to zero.
This helps CUSUM detect changes quickly.
Otherwise, a run of
lower-than-expected observations might delay
our discovery of an increase.
Basically, we're saying that if
the running total would be below zero,
it's irrelevant to the question of
whether we later see an increase.
But on the other hand,
we don't want it to be too sensitive
and say there's a change when there really isn't.
We expect there to be some randomness.
Sometimes in fact, maybe about half the time,
X_t will be higher than the expectation just at random.
So we include a value C
to pull the running total down a little bit.
The bigger C is the harder it is for
S_t to get large
and the less sensitive the method will be.
And the smaller C gets,
the more sensitive the method is
because S_t can get larger, faster.
And that's really about it.
CUSUM is a pretty mathematically simple method that
you can implement quickly even in a spreadsheet.
So you're probably wondering,
how do you choose the right values of C and
T so the model finds changes quickly,
but isn't so sensitive that it
often says they are changed when there really isn't.
The answer is that there really isn't a simple answer.
C and T are model parameters that you
have to use data to find the right values for.
And part of that decision depends on how
costly it is if the model takes a long time
to notice the change and how costly it is if
the model thinks it has found
the change that isn't really there.
For example, in a computer chip manufacturing process,
if a machine starts putting
a component a little too far to the left,
then each chip produced
between when the change starts and when it is
detected will have to be discarded and
there's a cost to that wasted material and time.
On the other hand, if CUSUM thinks
there's a change when the machine is really okay,
then valuable production time
might be lost while the repair crew
goes in and adjusts
the machine that was working fine anyway.
Part of setting the right values of C and T involves
trading off those costs of the two types of mistakes.
So let's see an example of how
CUSUM works with different values of C and
T. Here's a set of
observations from a reaction time study.
The question is whether someone's reaction time
slows down after a while.
And to test the CUSUM method,
we artificially added 100
to every observation from number t equals
11 onward and check to see how long
it takes CUSUM to notice that there is a change.
Here are the calculations using
a threshold T of 450 and C equal to 0.
You can see that it takes
several time periods to notice the change,
but it's still not too bad.
And here are the same calculations using a threshold of
T equals 150 and C equal to zero.
As you can see, it detects the change much faster but it
was also very close to
falsely detecting a change early on.
So that's an example of how CUSUM can
detect the change in the increasing direction.
It's just as easy to detect decreases.
Just use the same formula,
but look for negatives and decreases.
And if you want to look for both changes simultaneously,
just do both at once.
In fact, there's also a nice way to visualize this.
This is sometimes called a control chart.
We plot S_t over time and
if it ever gets beyond this threshold line,
it shows that CUSUM has detected a change.
So that's CUSUM.
Of course, there are other methods
for detecting changes too,
but we don't have time to go
through all of them in this course.
The important thing that I hope you take away from
this lesson is understanding the basic idea
of how changes can be detected and
the trade-off between early detection
and false detection,
as well as the straightforward CUSUM method
for observing changes over time.
