>> Hi, I'm Joel Sokol,
Director of the Master of Science in Analytics degree at
Georgia Tech and a professor in
Georgia Tech's Stewart School of ISYE.
We often talk in this course and in real life about using
specific data in our analysis
as predictors in a regression model,
factors in a classification model, etc.
For example, if we focus on numeric quantitative data,
we could use factors like a person's credit score,
the average daily temperature in Atlanta,
the number of hotdogs sold at each baseball game,
the value of a stock at five second intervals,
the amount of a certain chemical in
drinking water and lots of others.
Usually it sounds like we're
using those factors directly.
The factor value XIJ is
the exact number of hotdogs
sold or the exact value of the stock.
But sometimes the way we talk glosses
over the need to manipulate the data first.
As we'll see, sometimes
the scale of the data is important.
Using data like average household income,
which is often at a scale of 10^5 or higher,
along with credit score on a scale of 10^2,
can lead our algorithms down the wrong path.
There might be one or two data points
whose effect on the overall solution is
magnified out of proportion
because of how different they are from the rest.
And we'll see how to identify and deal with them.
Sometimes, we might suspect that
our data has a lot of extraneous information
in it that could complicate our model and
our ability to correctly interpret the solution.
In this topic, we will see how to avoid that issue too.
All of these potential problems
with data are things that we can address
before building and solving
the analytics models that are covered in this course.
When we talk about the data
used as inputs for those models,
we are generally assuming that we've already
done whatever data preparation steps are required.
And in the rest of this topic,
you'll learn exactly that,
how to prepare a set of data for use in analytics models.
