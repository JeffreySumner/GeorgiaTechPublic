>> In previous lessons,
we've seen what regression looks like graphically
and how to use the regression models solution,
the regression coefficients to answer
descriptive and predictive analytics questions.
In this lesson, we'll see how to
build more general regression models.
First, let's look at the inputs.
In the previous lessons,
we saw a general formula for linear regression.
Each attribute appears in this formula linearly,
its value x_i is
multiplied by regression coefficient a_i.
That works great if the data looks linear like this.
But what if the data looks
more like the graph on the right?
A linear approximation doesn't work well,
but a nonlinear fit like
this one is much closer to the data.
So we could transform the data to make the fit linear.
If the data looks like y equals x squared,
then we can include a quadratic term in the regression.
It basically creates a new column of data.
We can use any other function of the attributes we
want as well if it fits the data.
We can also transform the response.
For example, we could use
the regression to estimate the log of
the response or even
transform both the attributes and the response.
Box-Cox transformations are one type of
transformations that most statistical software
can automate for you.
It also might be that
the attributes interact in some way.
For example, if we're trying to
estimate a two-year-olds height at adulthood,
the child's height might be
related to the father's height,
the mother's height, and
to the product of the two heights.
Perhaps if both parents are tall, for example,
then the child is expected to
be even taller than we might
expect based on just the two parents individual heights.
So we can add an interaction term to
the regression equation to capture
how the two attributes interact with each other,
and just as before,
the interaction term can be transformed.
Once it's included as a new column of data,
it can be treated just like any other attribute.
Once we build a regression model with
interaction terms and transformations included,
we can use software to find the best fit coefficients,
and you'll get a chance to do
that in the upcoming homework assignment.
