>> In this short lesson, we will see the concept of
a norm and how it relates to calculating distance.
You're probably familiar with
the traditional straight line
or Euclidean distance measure.
Given two points, X and Y with coordinates x1,
x2 and y1, y2.
The distance between them is the square root of
x1 minus y1 squared plus x2 minus y2 squared.
A second common distance metric is rectilinear distance.
The absolute value of x1
minus y1 plus the absolute value of x2 minus y2.
This distance is sometimes used, for example,
when driving in a city where
streets are laid out as a grid,
which is why it's sometimes
also called the Manhattan distance.
We can generalize both of these to be
the absolute value of x1 minus y1 to
the pth power plus the absolute value of x2
minus y2 to the pth power
and take the pth root of that sum.
Where, p would be 2 for straight-line distance,
and p would be 1 for a rectilinear distance.
And if we happen to be in a space with more dimensions,
let's say n dimensions,
we can write this as the sum over all n dimensions of
xi minus yi absolute value to
the pth power and the pth root of all that sum.
This formula is known as the p-norm distance.
For example, the one norm distance,
the two norm distance, etc.
It's also called the Minkowski distance of
order p. In theory,
we could choose other values of p also,
p equals three, p equals 10,
p equals a 1,000 or anything else.
Surprisingly, the third most
common value of p that people
use is actually the infinity norm distance.
Anytime I talk about infinity
with people who don't use math for a living,
I can see their eyes start to glaze over.
In this case it has a meaning that's
actually pretty easy to understand.
Here's the formula with infinity
substituted for p. Now, technically,
we should probably refer to it as the limit as p
goes to infinity of this but let's ignore that.
Then a quick warning for all of you
who like formal mathematics,
I'm going to be very informal with my infinities in
this discussion because it's
easier to get a good intuition that way.
So let's write out the sum.
Now if we have n different numbers
all to the infinity power,
the largest one will dominate the rest.
For example, eight to the infinity
swamps seven to the infinity and the sum of
those two is so close to eight to
the infinity that seven to the infinity is irrelevant.
So this sum is just about equal to the largest
among the differences in
each dimension to the infinity power.
Now let's simplify.
We have the infinity yth root of
the infinity power of the largest difference.
The root and the power are the same,
so they cancel and we're left
with just the largest difference.
And that's all the infinity norm is the
largest of a set of numbers and absolute value.
If you're thinking that the phrase
infinity norm sounds like it
should mean something a lot more
complicated, join the club.
The first time I heard it was in
a casual conversation with a friend and I was
really impressed with them until I sat down and
worked out the math and realized
he just meant the biggest.
At this point, you might be wondering
two things, first,
what person has friends who say
infinity norm in casual conversation?
I know I have some friends who are pretty nerdy,
but this guy would say,
I'm pretty nerdy too so I guess it's
a good match and a good thing we both work in analytics.
Second, why would anyone ever
use the infinity norm as a distance measure?
Here's just one example.
Think about a warehouse that has
an automated storage and retrieval system.
In each aisle, there's a machine that moves
up and down the aisle to the right place,
and also stretches up and
down vertically to reach the right height.
Suppose we tell it to pick this item right here,
it might move along the aisle to
the right place and then
stop and stretch up to the right height.
If so, then the total time it takes before it can pick
the item is the along
the aisle time plus the up and downtime,
the exact definition of a one norm.
Suppose the machine was designed in a smarter way.
As it's moving down the aisle,
it's simultaneously stretching up
and down to the right height.
How long does it take from when it starts
moving until it's ready to pick the order,
whichever takes longer, moving or stretching.
If it gets to the right place along
the aisle before it finishes stretching,
then the stretch time is how long it takes to be ready.
And if it stretches to the right height
before it gets to the right place in the aisle,
then the along the aisle time
is how long it takes to be ready.
Either way, it's the larger of
the two times and that's
exactly the infinity norm of the two.
So now you're part of the club
too and the next time you are waiting in
the slowest checkout line at the supermarket or stuck in
highway traffic when all the other lanes
are moving and yours isn't,
don't be afraid to complain about infinity norms.
