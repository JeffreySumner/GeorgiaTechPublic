>> In the previous lesson,
we started learning about regression.
We saw two different types of
questions that regression can answer.
Descriptive questions about
how systems work and predictive questions
about what will happen with other,
perhaps future data points.
We also saw what regression look like graphically.
We're looking for a line of the form y equals a_0
plus a_1 x_1 plus 2x_2 up through a_mx_m,
that fits through our data points as closely as possible.
In this lesson, we will see how
to interpret regression coefficients.
Suppose we're given n data points,
each with a response and m different predictors.
Let y_i be the response of the ith data point and X_i,
j be the value of the jth predictor for data point i.
In linear regression, we find
coefficients a_1 through am and a constant a_0.
So the model best fits the data.
In the case of using regression to
answer questions about how systems work,
the key answers are the coefficients themselves.
For example, if we want to use regression to
determine how many runs
the average home run is worth in baseball.
We could compile data for
each team over the course of several seasons.
For each team and season,
the response would be how many
runs the team scored that season,
and the predictors could be
how many home runs, triples, doubles,
singles, out, double plays,
stolen bases, et cetera,
the team had that season.
After we fit a regression model,
we will have coefficients for
each of these baseball events.
If the team hits one more homerun,
the equation will suggest that the team should
score a sub one more runs.
Taking team data from
the past three major league baseball seasons,
a basic linear regression gives a value of about
1.4 for the coefficient of home runs.
In other words, every homerun hit will add an average
of 1.4 runs to the team's total.
On the other hand, if we're using regression to make
forecasts than the key answers
or the predicted responses.
For example, if we want to use regression to predict how
tall a two-year-old American
will be when he or she is an adult,
we could compile data for a lots of Americans.
For each person, the response
would be the person's height as an adult,
and the predictors could be things
like the person's father's height,
mother's height, their own height at age
two and whether the person is male or female.
After we fit a regression model,
we will again have coefficients
for each of those predictors.
So if we're given a new data point
without a response, for example,
a two-year-old boy's height
and the height of his mother and father,
then we can use this regression equation
to predict the boys response.
The boys predicted height as an adult.
And then if our model suggests he'll be seven feet tall,
we might immediately offer him
a scholarship to play basketball at Georgia Tech.
So we've now seen two different uses for regression.
One, to describe what's going
on and another to predict what will happen.
As we saw a way back in the introduction to this course,
those are two of the three major steps
are components of analytics.
Descriptive analytics, and predictive analytics.
The only question regression isn't directly
used to answer is a prescriptive analytics question.
So it's not surprising that regression is one of
the most commonly used tools in analytics.
And we'll spend several more lessons going through
a lot of the basics and extensions of regression.
