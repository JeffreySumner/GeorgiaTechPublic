>> In previous lessons,
we saw a method called
Exponential Smoothing for analyzing time-series data.
Data with the same response is
known for many time periods.
And we saw how exponential smoothing
really does smooth out the random peaks and valleys
in observed data to give
a clearer picture of
the baseline behavior of whatever we're tracking.
It turns out that exponential smoothing can
also be used to do simple forecasting.
Not just to see what happened in the past,
but also to predict what will happen next.
Here's how it works.
Here's the basic exponential smoothing equation.
Our baseline estimate, S_t for
this time period, t is Alpha times
the observed value X_t plus 1 minus Alpha
times the previous periods baseline estimate S_t minus 1.
Now suppose we're in time period t,
and we want to look one period ahead to time t plus 1,
and estimate what would happen then.
Here's what that equation looks like.
We don't know the observed value X_t plus 1,
and our best guess is just to use
the previous periods baseline estimate S_t.
When we make that substitution,
we get our forecast.
The forecast F_t plus 1 equals S_t.
In other words, our guess for
the next time period is the
same as our latest baseline estimate.
And continuing out, the same thing happens for
the next time period and all other future time periods.
The estimate remains the same,
so the forecast remains the same.
Of course, because there's more uncertainty,
the further into the future we go,
the anticipated forecast error gets larger too.
If we include the trend term,
it's not much more complicated.
Our best estimate of the next baseline
is the most current baseline estimate,
and our best estimate of the trend
is also the most current trend estimate.
So our forecast, F_t plus 1 equals S_t plus T_t,
the current period's baseline estimate,
plus the current estimate of how the baseline
is changing from one time period to the next.
And that's also the same going forward.
And finally, suppose we also
include a multiplicative seasonality.
We've already seen the best forecast
of the baseline and trend,
and our best estimate of
the next time period seasonal factors,
C_t plus 1,
is the latest estimate we have
at that same stage of the cycle.
Or C_t plus 1 minus
L. So our forecast for time period t plus 1,
F_t plus 1,
is S_t plus T_t times C_t plus 1 minus L. And again,
this remains the same going forward.
If we're going to use this method for forecasting,
you might be wondering how we can train
the model to find the best values of Alpha,
Beta, and Gamma to use.
It turns out that we can use optimization,
which itself is a whole other topic in this course.
We can measure the squared error in
every forecast F_t that we have,
as F_t minus X_t squared,
and minimize it over the whole training set.
Whatever values of Alpha, Beta,
and Gamma minimize that sum of squared error,
is the model's best-fit, subject, of course,
to all three values being between zero and one.
So that's the exponential smoothing method,
both for smoothing data and for doing simple forecasting.
Coming soon in another lesson,
will be a couple of other methods
for analyzing time-series data.
