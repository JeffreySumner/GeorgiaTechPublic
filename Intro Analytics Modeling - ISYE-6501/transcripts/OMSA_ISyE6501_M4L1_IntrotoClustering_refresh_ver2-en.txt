>> Hi, I'm Joel Sokol,
Director of the Master of Science
and Analytics degree at Georgia Tech
and a professor in Georgia Tech's Stewart School of ISyE.
In this lesson, we'll talk about clustering,
what it is and what kind of
questions it's useful for answering.
Then in later lessons,
we'll see a simple approach for finding good clusterings.
In analytics, Clustering means taking
a set of data points and dividing them
up into groups so each group contains
points that are close to each other or similar.
Here's a graph of some points and a natural way to
group them into three clusters so that for each cluster,
the points in each cluster are close to each other.
Let's see some examples of when
clustering might be useful.
Clustering is often useful
in targeted marketing where we want to
segment potential customers and
give each group a different message.
Different people react most
positively to different types of marketing messages
and we want each potential buyer to get
the message that's most likely to convince them to buy.
For example, if we're selling an SUV,
we might market it to
some people with its size highlighted,
look how much stuff you can carry in here,
to other people I'll highlight its price,
other people might be primarily shown its versatility,
and for other people, we might try to convince them
that they'll look cool if they're driving an SUV.
Each set of people would be a cluster and we tried to use
the data to determine how to
split up the consumers into sets,
and then for each cluster,
the marketing experts could determine
which type of marketing material they should be shown.
In fact, you might even discover from the clustering that
the groups you initially expected to see aren't correct.
For example, once you examine a cluster,
you might realize that it's made up of people who might
want to hear about an SUV's gas mileage.
So clustering doesn't just help you
segment into clusters you're expecting,
it can also help you discover
what clusters there are in your dataset.
Let's see some more examples.
Clustering might be useful in personalized medicine and
an ideal cluster could be a set of people
who might react similarly to treatment,
but different clusters would have different reactions.
Clustering can be used with physical distance.
For example, when locating
civic facilities like police stations, fire stations,
medical clinics or libraries,
we might cluster people by where they live
and put one police station in each cluster.
It's not just civic facilities
where clustering can be useful,
you can use similar approaches for locating gas stations,
fast food restaurants, etc.
I guess Starbucks might be an exception.
Instead of bothering with clustering,
they just decided to put a Starbucks on
every street corner. Just kidding.
Clustering is also used in image analysis, for example,
for re-coloring pictures or
recognizing faces and other objects.
I'm sure you've all seen
online forms that use things like CAPTCHA.
You have to look at pictures of handwritten numbers or
letters and type them in to prove that you are a human.
Those pictures have had to get
more and more ambiguous because
other people's clustering algorithms are getting better
and better at figuring out
what number or letter is written.
Another use of clustering is
for initial data investigation.
If we can find obvious clusters of data then we can
analyze each cluster separately
in case they have different properties.
For example, predicting how much
a customer is willing to spend on an SUV might
require a different model depending on
which attribute the customer cares most about,
size, price, versatility, or perceived coolness.
Let's go back now and see what
clustering looks like graphically.
Here's a simple graph of
some data on potential SUV buyers,
as usual in two-dimensions because it's
easiest to see and easiest for me to draw.
In this graph, the horizontal axis is age and
the vertical axis is number of miles driven per year.
Suppose we have all of
these points and we want to divide them into clusters.
We'll see how to divide them
algorithmically in another lesson,
for now, let's just do it by eye.
If we want two clusters to
send two types of targeted messages,
Here's a reasonable way of splitting the data,
and here's a three-cluster solution
and a four-cluster solution,
we can add even more clusters too if we want to.
If you're wondering how to decide
how many clusters to use,
that's a good question, hang on to that question,
we'll discuss it in another lesson.
But first, we'll see you in the next lesson a basic
machine learning algorithm to find good clusterings.
