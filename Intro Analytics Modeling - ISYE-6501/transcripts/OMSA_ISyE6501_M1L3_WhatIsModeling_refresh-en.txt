>> In this short lesson,
I'm going to try to head off
a potential source of confusion.
In analytics, people use
the word model to mean three slightly different things.
In the course introduction,
we talked about how modeling means taking
a real-life situation and expressing
the key parts of that situation in terms of math.
So we can analyze the math and then turn
the mathematical analysis back into
a real-life answer or solution or recommendation.
The mathematical expression of
the real-life situation is called a model.
And confusingly, there are
at least three different ways of
using the word model and analytics.
If I say that I'm going to use
regression to predict the delivery date of
packages accompanying ships out
then regression is referred to as a model.
If you don't know what regression is yet, don't worry,
it's a type of analytics model that we'll
see a fair amount of in this course.
So by the time we're done,
you'll know plenty about regression.
Anyway, if I plan to use
regression to predict the delivery dates,
then regression is the model I'm using.
And if I go one level of detail
lower and say that I'm going to
use regression to predict
delivery dates based on a package's size, weight,
and distance between where
it's being shipped from and where it's
being shipped to then all that detail,
the use of regression and the use of size,
weight, and distance is also called a model.
And if I go even one more step and
use regression to find that the time for a package to
be delivered is approximately equal to
37 plus 81 times the sum of
its linear dimensions plus
76 times its weight plus 4 times the delivery distance,
then that specific equation is also called a model.
So I apologize in advance if
the word model is sometimes confusing.
It can mean all of these different things and I'll use
it often to mean each of those three in the same lesson.
And just like anything else in the course,
if you're not sure what I mean,
please go to the discussion forums and ask.
There are a great place to
get all of your questions answered.
