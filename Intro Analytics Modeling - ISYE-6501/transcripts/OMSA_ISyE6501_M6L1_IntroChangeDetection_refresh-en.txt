Director of the Master of Science in
Analytics degree at Georgia Tech
and a professor in Georgia Tech's Stewart School of ISyE.
In this lesson, we'll talk about change detection.
We'll see what it is and some examples of
the kind of questions it's useful for answering.
Then in later lessons,
we'll see a basic approach for detecting changes.
As you might expect, change detection
is exactly what it sounds like,
determining whether something has changed.
Because we're talking about changes,
it makes sense that we'll usually be using
time-series data or at least data
with some time attribute.
Here are some examples of when
change detection is important.
First, we might want to look at
the data to see if we need to do something.
For example, in a manufacturing process,
does a machine that's displaying
some variation in performance need maintenance,
or is it just random variation?
A hot topic these days is whether
the global temperature has changed.
And a company might want to know whether
sales of their products have changed.
For example, are they decreasing due to new competition?
A second type of question we can answer with
change detection is whether
an action we took had any impact.
For example, did a policy change have the desired effect?
If the national business tax rates got lowered,
did businesses hire more people, for example?
Or in the case of an individual business,
when they offered a promotion like
a discount on one of their products,
was there an effect on sales?
And sometimes we might just want to see if there are
any differences over time to help
us plan or analyze for the future.
For example, have there been changes in voting patterns?
Here are a couple of other examples in
my own research where change detection was important.
I did some work a couple of years ago for
a major semiconductor manufacturer.
In the semiconductor manufacturing process,
there are several 100 steps,
and as wafers go through the steps,
they need to be transported from
machine to machine to machine.
Because the process is so sensitive to
even small dirt or dust particles,
they don't use people to move wafers between machines.
Instead, the process takes
place in a giant clean room where
automated vehicles run on
overhead tracks automatically picking up wafers,
driving them along the overhead rails
and dropping them off at the next machine.
With so many wafers in the room
simultaneously and so many steps in each one's process,
they might need a couple of 100
of these automated vehicles,
and the problem was that they were running into traffic.
A central controller was telling machines which way to
go and the roots they chose looked great at the time,
but by the time the transport vehicles
got to a critical intersection,
there could be a huge backup of traffic.
Eventually, it could even deadlock the whole system.
The change detection issue was
a big part of what we had to deal with.
How do you identify when traffic is starting to build
up and will be a problem five-minutes in the future,
even if it isn't a problem right now?
Here's a second example from
a student project I supervised several years ago,
dealing with Railroad Safety.
Occasionally, rail car's axles
fail and lead to derailment.
So along railroad tracks there are
high-tech sensors to detect how hot an axle is.
The axle temperature is then
used as a predictor of failure.
The railroads would like to stop
the train when axle temperature rises,
but before it actually fails,
then do some preventive maintenance
and return the rail car to service.
That would prevent a big derailment that would be
very costly in terms of money and even lives.
But there's a lot of random fluctuation
in the axle temperature between sensors.
Here's a figure showing the ideal scenario.
In this case, the first
time we see a high temperature reading,
it would be a reliable warning
that a real problem exists,
and the railroad could remove
the car from service before the failure.
But what we actually see from
the sensors is something like this.
As you can see here,
every high reading might not
be meaningful and the difficulty
is that if we wait until we're
really sure the temperature is too high,
then it might be too late.
In fact, our first approach was
to use hypothesis testing,
but if we waited until
the hypothesis test met the standard threshold,
it turns out we had to wait so
long that the axle would be broken already.
Instead, we needed an approach that
more quickly identified potential problems,
even though we had to accept some false positives.
And in a future lesson,
we'll see a basic method to do just that,
to detect change more flexibly.
