>> Hi. I'm Joel Sokol Director of
the Master of Science in Analytics Degree
at Georgia Tech and a Professor in
Georgia Tech's Stewart School of ISE.
In this lesson, we'll talk about classification,
including what it means,
examples of when it's important,
and a simple demonstration of how classification works.
Then in later lessons,
we'll see a basic model
for solving classification problems.
Classification and analytics has
the same meaning as it does in
everyday life putting things into categories.
The simplest examples of
classification are when there are two categories,
which are often just yes and no.
For example, a bank might want to differentiate between
loan applications who will
fully repay their loan and those who won't.
A security agency might want to differentiate
between a regular person and a potential terrorist.
An automated email filter might need to
differentiate between real and spam email.
A legal document system might
be designed to differentiate between
documents that are relevant or
irrelevant to a certain case.
In my own research,
we're working with the CDC on a project to increase
the number of organs that can be
given to people in need of a transplant.
And one of the questions we use analytics to answer is,
is this organ safe to transplant or
does it carry a deadly infectious disease?
Of course, one answer would be to
subject the organ to a laboratory test,
but if the donor was recently infected,
the test might not come out positive yet.
So we need the analytical approach.
In each case, we can use
classification models to put applicants,
people, documents, livers, etc,
into one of the categories.
And as you can imagine,
having more than two categories as well is possible.
For example, a political consultant might want to
differentiate between supportive voters,
opposition voters, and undecided voters or
a paleontologist might want to differentiate
between many different species of dinosaurs to
determine which one in newfound bone belongs to.
Each of these classification questions will
require some data in order to get answers.
For example, for loan applicants,
a bank might collect data on income,
credit history, age, family size,
assets, liabilities, and more.
Based on those attributes of
previous loan recipients and
the bank's observation of
whether each loan was repaid or not,
the bank can then build a model to
help classify future applicants.
Let's see how this would look graphically.
Suppose the bank is trying to
decide whether or not to give loans to
applicants using the applicants
credit scores and incomes.
So we can plot each past
recipients information on this graph.
The horizontal axis will show
credit score and the vertical axis
will show household income.
For example, someone with a credit score of 730 and
an income of $76,000 a year would be this data point.
If they repaid the entire loan,
we'll mark the data point in blue.
If they defaulted, we'll mark it in red.
Of course, in real life,
there might be other factors,
each of which would be another dimension,
length of time as a customer of
this bank might be a third factor,
number of dependents might be a fourth,
total assets and liabilities would be a fifth and so on.
But as my wife,
the artist, could tell you,
I have enough trouble drawing
clear two-dimensional pictures.
Three-dimensions is really iffy for me and I
have no idea how to draw it on four more.
So we'll use this two-dimensional picture
to see how classification works.
As you can see, we can draw a line like this that
separates between the blue points
above and the red points below.
So if we want to use this data to
decide whether to offer a loan to a new applicant,
we can just see where the new applicants data point
would be relative to the line.
An applicant up here,
would be in the blue zone.
So we might want to give them a loan.
An applicant down here,
would be in the red zone so we
might not want to give them a loan.
But how do we know that we've drawn the right line?
There are lots of lines, infinitely many,
in fact, that would also
separate the blue points from the red ones.
Wow, stop. Too many lines.
You might be wondering what's
the difference between all the lines we choose.
After all, they all seem to
separate between the blue and red points.
Which one is the best?
That's a great question.
And in a future lesson,
we'll see the answer.
