>> In this lesson, we'll talk about many of
the different types of data you
might encounter in analytics.
And just as importantly,
we'll go through some of
the terminology that analytics and
data science professionals use
for different types of data.
So I apologize in
advance if this lesson might be a little
less interesting than some others where
you learn a new analysis technique.
But it's important to make sure
that we're all on the same page in
terms of vocabulary as we go further into this course.
And it'll also be helpful for your career to help
you communicate easily with other analytics people.
So let's break out
our analytics dictionary and get started.
First, let's see the mental model of
data that most people use when they talk about it.
Usually, people in analytics
talk about data as if it's in a table.
In this table, every row is called a data point.
It's a single observation of information.
For example, if we're looking at past loan applicants
to see which future applicants
might be good credit risks,
then each applicant would be a data point.
Or if we're analyzing
daily sales to predict what future sales will be,
then each day would be a data point.
Each column of the table is
a piece of information about every data point.
For example, in the credit risk table,
one column of data might
contain each applicant's credit score.
Another column might contain
each applicant's household income and a
third might contain each applicant's zip code.
In the sales prediction example,
one column of data might
contain the number of sales on that day,
a second might contain the day of the week and a
third might indicate whether
or not the day was a holiday.
We've already seen that every row is called a data point.
For columns, there are lots of different names.
They're often called attributes or
features and depending on how the data is being used,
they might also be called covariates or predictors.
There's also a special type of column
known as the response or outcome.
You can think of this column as
being the answer for each data point.
For loan applicants, it's
the observation of whether they
repaid the full loan or not,
or it could be the fraction of
the loan they repaid from 0-100%.
For sales, the response could be
the number of sales recorded on each day.
Now that we've laid out the mental model that
most people use to refer to data,
let's look at some different types of data.
First, we'll see the difference
between structured and unstructured data.
Structured data is what
most people envision when we think of data.
There are some formal technical definitions
of structured data but essentially,
it's data that can be described and
stored in a nice structured way, for example,
a credit score, age,
number of sales, etc,
are all stored as numbers.
A person's sex is often
stored as a single letter M or F,
either M for male or F for female.
And hair color can be stored
as a choice of just a few words.
Black, brown, red,
blonde, or in my case, grey.
On the other hand, unstructured data
isn't easily described and stored.
The most common example of unstructured data is text.
For example, I'm working with
a police department trying to glean
information and insight from the text
of police officer's incident reports.
Different officers might write
their reports very differently and we
have to parse through all the text to
find valuable connections and trends.
Within the category of structured data,
there are some common types of data that
we've all probably seen before.
First, let's look at numbers.
Most numeric data is quantitative.
The numbers have a meaning.
Age, number of sales, temperature,
income, those are all examples of quantitative data.
Higher values mean there's more of it
and lower values mean there's less of it.
But sometimes a number doesn't
have any quantitative meaning.
It just shows which category something is in.
Zip codes, for example,
don't imply anything more or less.
When I move from zip code 07470 to zip code 02139,
it didn't mean that anything decreased.
And when I moved from 02139 to 30318,
nothing increased,
the numbers just denote different categories.
This data is called categorical data.
There's also a special case of
categorical data called binary data.
A binary attribute can take only two values.
A person could be male or female,
or either repaid the full loan
or didn't repay the full loan.
A day could be a holiday or not a holiday,
a television could be on or off.
As we'll see in a later lesson,
binary data can sometimes be treated as quantitative,
even though it's categorical.
There's one last thing we should
cover in our basic data dictionary.
Sometimes data points are unrelated.
Each loan applicant is a different person with
no relationship to most other loan applicants.
On the other hand, sometimes data is related in time.
For example, let's go back to our daily sales data.
Each data point refers to one day and we have
an attribute that records
each day's sales one after the other.
If we put those data points in chronological order,
then reading down the column of data shows the number of
sales made day-by-day, one after another.
That's called time series data.
Time series data is often recorded
at equal intervals, for example,
a company sales each day,
the price of a stock every two seconds,
or the height of a child
recorded each year on her birthday.
But it's also possible to have
time-series data that isn't recorded at equal intervals.
That's a lot of definitions to pack into one lesson.
The good news is, since we'll be using
this terminology a lot as we go through the course,
you'll have plenty of
opportunity to get comfortable with it.
But I don't expect that
you'll remember it all right away,
so we've posted a document
that has all of these definitions
and others for easy access anytime you need it. Enjoy.
