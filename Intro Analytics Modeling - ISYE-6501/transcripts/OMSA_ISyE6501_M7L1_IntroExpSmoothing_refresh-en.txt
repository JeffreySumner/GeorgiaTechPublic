>> In this lesson, we will see a method called
Exponential Smoothing for analyzing time-series data.
Data where the same response is
known for many time periods.
As we've seen,
some examples of time series data are
the highest temperature reading at
the Atlanta airport each day,
the price of a stock every two seconds,
daily sales of hamburgers at a restaurant,
blood pressure readings over time and things like that.
We might expect the time series data
will show some variation.
There might be trends over time,
the price of the stock could generally be
increasing as the company gains market share,
or a hamburger sales might generally be decreasing as
the restaurant expands its menu
to give customers more choices.
There might also be cyclical variations.
Temperatures are higher in summer than in winter or
a restaurant might have more sales
on weekends than weekdays.
We will see how to model these variations.
But there's another source of variation we
have to deal with first, randomness.
Temperatures, stock prices, blood pressure,
and hamburger sales vary simply due to random variation.
On some days people are just more in
the mood for hamburgers than on other days.
And the graph of daily sales
might show random fluctuations.
Similarly, the graph of
someone's blood pressure over
time will also show fluctuations.
Because of that randomness,
it might be hard to determine what someone's
expected baseline blood pressure really is.
Should a doctor take action or is
the patient's blood pressure really about the same?
And that's where a method like
exponential smoothing comes in handy.
Let's call S_t,
the expected baseline response for time period t. A
person's expected blood pressure at
our t of the day, for example.
And let's call X_t, the observed response,
the actual blood pressure measured at time
t. Imagine where the doctor,
and we want to try to figure out what
the patient's blood pressure has really
been like over time without all the random variation.
And if the blood pressure
reading today is different, what does that mean?
Maybe the patient's blood pressure
is different than usual.
Does that indicate an increase in
the baseline or was it just random outside events?
For example, the patient took his blood pressure
while watching an exciting sporting event.
There are two ways we might answer this question.
We might think that
the observed blood pressure is
a real indicator of the baseline.
So S_t equals X_t.
Or we might think that there's
no change to the baseline and
the higher observed blood pressure
today is just due to random luck.
So really S_t equals S_t minus 1.
Today's baseline is the same as yesterday's baseline.
The exponential smoothing method
combines these two ideas.
S_t equals Alpha times the observed reading X_t,
plus 1 minus alpha times
yesterday's baseline S_t minus 1,
where alpha is just a number between 0 and 1.
So if we think there's a lot of
randomness in the system,
then fluctuations are probably
mostly due to randomness and
we should make alpha closer to 0.
Yesterday's baseline is probably a good indicator of
today's baseline even if
we observed something different today.
And on the other hand,
if there's not much randomness in the system,
then we should make alpha closer to 1.
If we observe a fluctuation today it probably
means today's baseline is close to the observed data.
There's just one more small detail.
How do we start? As the initial condition we can
choose S_1 equal to x_1 and then build up from there.
This method doesn't yet deal with things like trends,
whether blood pressure might be increasing
or decreasing over time for example,
or with cyclical variations.
But in a future lesson,
we'll see how to include trend and
cyclical variation into exponential smoothing models.
