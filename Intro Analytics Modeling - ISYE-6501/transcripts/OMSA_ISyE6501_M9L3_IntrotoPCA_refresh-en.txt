>> Hi I'm Joel Sokol Director of the Master of Science in
Analytics degree at Georgia Tech and
a professor in Georgia Tech's Stewart School of ISYE.
In this lesson we're going to talk about
feature extraction using a method called
principal component analysis or
PCA for dealing with
high dimensional and correlated data.
In many analytics applications
we might have lots of factors that we can
use in our model and we want to know which subset
of them are most important for predicting response.
For example we might wonder whether we
could use the performance of certain stocks
on one day to predict
overall market performance on the next day.
In that case we can have a lot of predictors.
In the United States about 3,000
securities are traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
Another approximately 3,000 are traded on
the Nasdaq plus a few 100 traded on ethics.
Of course sometimes external events
have a strong effect on the markets; wars,
terrorist attacks, election results,
natural disasters, etc all can have significant effects.
But maybe on other days there's
a good combination of stocks we could use for prediction.
But there are two difficulties with this approach.
First with more than 6,000 predictors not
even including possible interaction effects
or other variables.
We would need lots of data to
avoid having the system be over determined.
Since each data point is
one day that means we need many years of
data so many that
the underlying situation we're
trying to model might have changed.
For example perhaps these days,
Tesla's stock is a good predictor
but Tesla wasn't publicly traded
until mid 2010 so we won't be
able to see its effect in much of our dataset.
On the other hand maybe back in 1997,
Kmart stock would have been
a good predictor but it was merged with
Sears in 2004 and
these days many Kmart stores have been closed.
We'd like a way to reduce the number of predictors we
use and we don't want to need so many years of data.
And there's a second potential problem.
Some of the predictors might be highly correlated,
for example within the energy sector
the stock prices of ExxonMobil,
Chevron and Phillips 66 might move
up and down relatively in sync with each other.
The same might be true about
General Motors and Ford for example.
The good news is that we can
often address both problems at
once using a method called
principal component analysis or PCA.
PCA is a way to transform data to do two things.
It changes the coordinates to remove
correlation and it ranks
the coordinate dimensions in order of the amount of
variance in each so
the most important coordinates are first.
Concentrating on the first n principal components
can also have the benefit of
reducing the effect of randomness.
If the randomness is about
the same level for every factor then
the first principal component is hired is
likely to have a higher signal to noise ratio.
The variation between the data points
is likely to be driven by
a higher ratio of actual effects to random effects.
The further down the list of principal components we go
the lower the signal to noise ratio is likely to be.
Before we get to the math,
let me show you a picture of what PCA looks like.
Here's a picture of some data that has
two dimensions, two factors.
As you can see there's
a strong correlation between the two factors.
The higher one gets,
the higher the other one gets.
But if we were to rotate the picture
and then create a new coordinate system in
this rotation then the correlation
between directions in the new coordinate system is 0.
The two directions are orthogonal.
If we express our data in terms of
these new coordinates there won't be
any correlation and of course
rotating the picture was
just to make it look more obvious,
we could rotate the picture
back and the correlation is still 0.
So that's pretty cool but
there's even a little more going on here.
Let's call our two new dimensions d1 and d2.
As you can see the data has a much wider spread of
values in the d1 direction
than it does in the d2 direction.
PCA will recognize that and automatically make
d1 the first dimension and d2 the second dimension.
If we just want to use
a one-dimensional factor we
know that d1 is a better bet than d2.
And that's all PCA really is except of course for
the underlying math and that
math is what we'll see in an upcoming lesson.
